## Introduction
The relationship between group emotion (sentiment) and changes in stock prices is one which looks at how group emotions (sentiment) moves stock prices. One such area is to analyze the sentiment of events that might affect stock prices. This is the area of sentiment analysis. Sentiment analyses employ a variety of techniques to “gauge” the sentiment of investors or the public  on  events. Our group has chosen to look at the relationship between sentiments and the stock market by social media commentary. A major instrument of sentiment is X (formerly called Twitter).

Twitter(X) is among the top social media sites around the globe with over 586 million active users in 2025 (Statista). Twitter(X) differentiates itself from other social media platforms by focusing on short form Tweets(Posts) of 280 characters or less in addition to images and videos. This format allows Twitter(X) to stay at the forefront of pop culture as users can share and consume a large variety of opinions, news, sentiments, and humour in a significantly smaller amount of time as compared to competitors like Facebook that allow long form content with a character limit of 63,206 (Chaires). Every day, millions of users flock to the platform to share their sentiments on almost any topic imaginable. For this reason, Twitter(X) is a valuable resource for sentiment data across a wide variety of generations, cultures, and locations across the globe.

## Literature Review
The relationship between emotions and the stock market is well confirmed in literature.
Such era’s as the Great Crash of 1929, the Black Market Monday crash of October 1967, and the Dot-com bubble in the 1990s have shown dramatic changes in stock prices. These events are hard to explain by classical economic theory where unemotional investors always force capital prices to equal the rational present value of expected future cash flow (Baker and Wurgler, 2007). There have been several theories that attempted to explain this relationship. The most prominent or most researched are (1) Prospect Theory, (2) Herd Behavior, (3) Overreaction Hypothesis, (4) Behavioral Biases, and (5) Sentiment Indicators.

Prospect Theory was developed by Tversky and Kahneman as an improvement to expected utility theory, which would better explain decisions made under risk. In looking at the value of a stock, classical economic theory (e.g. Adams) assumes a totally rational investor which maximizes investments based on mathematical probabilities and outcomes, without taking into effect such emotions (Smith, 1776). However, Prospect Theory takes the view that people make decisions.
